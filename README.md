## Code Architecture
The project is split into the front-end viewer/controller and the back-end model.  See the branches for each.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests for any feature, but especially support contributing new puzzles.  Look in the back-end branch's
puzzles folder for examples of how to create a puzzle.  Once you've created a puzzle, make sure to add the puzzle name to the puzzleFactory, and it should be automatically incorporated into your game!
